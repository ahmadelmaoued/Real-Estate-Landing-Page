Overview

This project is a fully responsive fake real estate landing page showcasing properties, features, and a user-friendly contact section. While the website itself is fictional, it demonstrates real-world front-end development techniques including:

Modern and clean layout

Interactive UI elements

Hover effects and animations

Smooth navigation

A working contact form (front-end only)

Responsive design for all screen sizes

I built this landing page to improve my development skills, learn by debugging through trial and error, and get more comfortable writing clean, reusable code.
