• Modern and clean layout

• Interactive UI elements

• Hover effects and animations

• Smooth navigation

• A working contact form (front-end only)

• Responsive design for all screen sizes


 Features

A bold introduction with a call-to-action button and visually appealing real estate imagery.

Subtle animations, transitions, and hover effects that make the UI feel alive.

✔️ Property Highlights

A section showing the property advantages, unique selling points, or features.

✔️ Contact / Inquiry Form

A front-end form where users can enter details to request more information.
(Note: It does not send data to a backend — it is for demonstration purposes only.)
